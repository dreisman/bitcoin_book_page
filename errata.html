<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The text states:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 6.1 shows a snippet of the Wikileaks donation page... Notice the refresh button next to the donation address. As you might expect, clicking the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">button will replace the donation address with an entirely new, freshly generated address. Similarly, if you refresh the page or close it and visit it later, it will have another address, never previously seen. That&rsquo;s because Wikileaks wants to make sure that each donation they receive goes to a new public key that they create just for that purpose. Wikileaks is taking maximal advantage of the ability to create new pseudonyms. This is in fact the best practice for anonymity used by Bitcoin wallets.</span></em></p>
<p>The text is correct about the behavior of the refresh button, but wrong about what happens if you refresh the page. Wikileaks and most other donation-accepting sites use a static address by default for receiving donations (we verified this by examining this <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Donation-accepting_organizations_and_projects">list</a> of donation pages and using the <a href="https://archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> to see if the displayed address changes over time). Some, like Wikileaks, offer the user the option of requesting a fresh donation address, but most don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It is unclear why sites don&rsquo;t take advantage of the opportunity for greater privacy. We can think of a few potential reasons: the cognitive benefits of having a single widely-advertised donation address; the engineering complexity of keeping track of an unbounded number of addresses and keys; and publicizing previously received donations as a way to generate social proof.</p>

<td style="width: 55%;">The text states that it has been proven that there are an infinite number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime">Mersenne primes</a> (primes of the form <em>2<sup>p</sup>-1</em>, where <em>p</em> is prime). This is incorrect, at least as of the time of writing. The statement is a conjecture backed by empirical evidence and widely believed to be true, but like many statements about the distribution of prime numbers, a proof remains elusive.</td>
