## About the book
_Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies_ provides a comprehensive introduction to the revolutionary yet often misunderstood new technologies of digital currency. Whether you are a student, software developer, tech entrepreneur, or researcher in computer science, this authoritative and self-contained book tells you everything you need to know about the new global money for the Internet age.

How do Bitcoin and its block chain actually work? How secure are your bitcoins? How anonymous are their users? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? These are some of the many questions this book answers. It begins by tracing the history and development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and then gives the conceptual and practical foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network as well as to integrate ideas from Bitcoin into your own projects. Topics include decentralization, mining, the politics of Bitcoin, altcoins and the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the future of Bitcoin, and more.

## Coursera course

The Coursera course <A href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> is a useful complement to this textbook. It has a series of video lectures that closely follow the textbook content, plus programming assignments and quizzes.

## Programming assignments
There are three programming  assignments which will take you through the steps of designing and building a basic cryptocurrency. The programming language we use for the assignments is Java. This is not because we're fans of Java, but because the infrastructure we used for creating grading scripts is Java-based.

</div>
<br></br>
The zip file contains three folders. In each folder, the assignment specification is provided as a PDF file. You're also provided starter code in the form of .java files.

We've used these assignment in courses that we've taught, but there may still be bugs in them. We appreciate your understanding and would be grateful for any bug reports. Email us at [bitcoinbook@lists.cs.princeton.edu](mailto:bitcoinbook@lists.cs.princeton.edu).
<br>

We also have grading scripts for each of these assignments. If you're an instructor and would like access to the grading scripts, please send us a brief email in which you introduce yourself and  tell us about your course.
